# SimplyMath - Basic math learners for Elementary School

This was initially a little program (sirca 2015) meant for my sister.

It teaches multiply and devide tables. By getting high scores, you will be able to unlock included games.

Nothing special really, but this program was eventually presented as a diploma work for my Junior Computer Academy "ItStep" and even got to participate in "Golden Byte Ukraine" competition.
